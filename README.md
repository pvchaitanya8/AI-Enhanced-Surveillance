## AI Enhanced Surveillance System


### Project Description

The Face Recognition Surveillance System is designed to automate surveillance by searching for a particular person in a live camera feed using facial recognition technology. The system identifies faces in the camera feed and triggers an alert if a match is found in the database.

### Technical Details

The project leverages artificial intelligence and Python for its implementation. However, the flexibility is maintained for alternative technologies if they prove to be more suitable for the project's requirements.

### Project Status

Currently, the project is in its initial stages of development. Below is an outline of the envisioned implementation:

## Input Page

The Input Page serves as the main interface for users and offers two primary options:

1. **Start Searching from Webcam:**
   - Clicking on this option initiates the process of searching for faces in the live camera feed.
   
2. **Editing Database:**
   - Provides access to the database management section for adding, modifying, or removing search profiles.

## Editing Database Page

This page allows users to manage the database of search profiles. The following features are envisioned:

- **Add New Search Profiles:**
  - Users can input information such as images, names, IDs, and other details to create new search profiles.

- **Save or Cancel:**
  - After entering the necessary information, users can choose to save the changes or cancel the operation.

- **Home Button:**
  - A convenient button to navigate back to the Input Page.

## Start Searching from Webcam Page

This page focuses on the live search functionality. Key features include:

- **Real-time Face Recognition:**
  - The system actively searches for faces in the webcam feed using the pre-loaded search profiles.

- **Alert Mechanism:**
  - If a match is found, an alert is triggered to notify the user about the identified person.

### Getting Started

To get started with the Face Recognition Surveillance System, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Install the required dependencies as specified in the project documentation.
3. Run the application and access the Input Page.
4. Choose between starting the search from the webcam or editing the database.
5. Follow the on-screen instructions to interact with the system.
